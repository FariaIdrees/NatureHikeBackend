Hunza is blessed with some sky-kissing heavenly mountains, beautiful lakes, rivers, glaciers, rich history, adventure spots, and amazing people. Hunza Valley shares international borders with China through Khunjerab Pass and Afghanistan through Irshad Pass in Lugpar Valley. The history of Hunza possibly dates back to the era of Alexander the Great, but there are no clear pieces of evidence. Some also relate Hunza to the Huns or Mangols.c`,

Karakoram Highway is approximately 1300 km long in Pakistan. It crosses through Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit Baltistan regions in Pakistan and enters China at Khunjerab Pass, the Pak-China border. This highway is also known as National Highway 35 (or N-35) and becomes China National Highway G314 as it enters China. It is a part of the project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC. It is considered to be the 8th wonder of the world. KKH is a complete package for nature lovers. It offers glimpses of mountains, lakes, rivers, glaciers, cities, villages, agricultural life, and much more.`,

    title: "Altit Fort",
    text: `Altit Fort was strategically built atop a massive rock in the old town of Altit Hunza Valley for the Rulers of Hunza (Mirs) Valley. This nearly 1100 years old fort is one of the oldest structures in Gilgit Baltistan. It also has a 200-meter-high watch tower that looked over Hunza Valley and the old Silk Route. The Mirs of Hunza resided in the fort for nearly three centuries. Later, they moved to the newly constructed Baltit Fort. The old Altit Town near the fort has been the residence of people from Central Asia, China, and the surrounding areas throughout the different eras, showcasing the historical significance of this place. It is believed that Alexander The Great came here with his soldiers back in time. This fort was granted to the Baltistan Heritage Trust by the Mirs of Hunza. The trust later restored it to its current state with the help of the Agha Khan Trust. Today, it is open to tourists. Guided tours are conducted at the fort everyday, which is included in the fort's entry ticket. These guided tours are vital in educating people about the history of the region. A small café at the foothills of Altit Fort serves traditional food and is run by local women of Hunza Valley, known as the Kha Basi Café. Learn more about it in: Must-Visit Cafes & Restaurants in Hunza.`,

    title: "Attabad Lake",
    text: `Attabad Lake is a 21 km long glacial lake formed in 2010 due to an earthquake in the area. The quake triggered a massive landslide from the nearby mountains. It was like an entire mountain fell on the villages, killing around 20 people and affecting thousands. This landslide blocked the flow of the Hunza River for over five months, which took the form of a dam submerging towns like Attabad, Shishkat, Ayeenabad, Gulkin, and Gulmit, forming the Attabad Lake. This newly formed lake blocked a massive chunk of Karakoram Highway, putting people's lives on halt in the upper parts of Hunza. People started using boats temporarily for mobility on the immersed part of KKH. But this momentary solution couldn't continue for longer. This part of the road was rebuilt, which created a wave of possibilities for the local people of Hunza, and Attabad Lake emerged as one of the most famous tourist destinations worldwide.There are several 3 to 5-star hotels, rest houses, and resorts around the lake providing state-of-the-art services to the visitors. If you yearn for some adventure, you can also camp by the lake for the night. There are a variety of touristy activities available at the, including boating, jet skiing, and ziplining, and a range of food stalls are open near the lake to munch in while exploring the lake.`,

It stands as the highest-paved international border crossing in the world, with an elevation of 4693 meters, making it the highest point on the Karakoram Highway. Khunjerab Pass is also home to the highest ATM in the world. After the construction of KKH, Khunjerab Pass provides a road connection between Cina's Xinjiang province and Gilgit Baltistan. It is used for trade, travel, and tourism purposes between the two nations. Sost Town in Upper Hunza serves as a dry port for all trading. Due to the high elevation of Khunjerab Pass, it receives a lot of snowfall, making it inaccessible during winter. Khunjerab Pass is located within the Khunjerab National Park and spans from Sost Town to the border with China. During the summer months, if fortunate enough, visitors can witness wildlife such as Yaks, Himalayan Markhor, and Ibex. Your tour to Hunza Valley will be incomplete without a visit to Khunjerab Pass.`,

    text: `First on the list of places to visit in Lahore is Lahore Fort, or Shahi Qila (in Urdu شاہی قلعہ), a UNESCO World Heritage site located in the heart of the Walled City of Lahore. The history of Lahore Fort is still unknown due to the absence of historical records. According to the 11th-century historians during Mehmud Ghazanavi's rule, it was a mudbrick fort in the beginning.
It was modified, or new elements were added during different dynasties according to their fancies and requirements, like the Mehmud Ghaznavi, Mamluk Dynasty, Lodhi Dynasty, Mughals, and the Sikh Rule by Ranjit Singh. As Lahore Fort was a citadel of Lahore, when the intruders came to take over Lahore, the fort was also damaged every time.
The Mughals largely constructed the current structure. The Alamgiri Gate, which used to be the main entrance to the fort, was constructed by the last Mughal ruler Aurangzeb Alamgir. Lahore Fort has served as the residence and court of these sovereigns, which shows its essence.
The architecture of the fort gives us an Islamic and Hindu Architectural essence. Some important elements of the fort are Sheesh Mehal, Daulat Khan-e-Khas-o-Aam, Alamgiri Gate, Shahi Burj Gate, Jahangir's Quadrangle, Shah Jahan's Quadrangle, Ladies Garden, Kala Burj, Court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Ath Dara Building, Naulakha Pavilion, the Picture Wall, Elephant steps, Moti Masjid, Shahi Bawarchi Khana (Royal Kitchens), Musaman Gate, Sikh Gallery, Makatib Khana, Lal Burj, British Jail, Horses Park, Masti Gate, Fort's Servants Quarter, Akbari Hammam, Sehdari Pavilion, Akbari Mehal, Barood Khana, and Deewan-e-Aam.
Our main charm on the Lahore Walled City Tour is Lahore Fort Tour.`,

    text: `Second on the list of places to visit in Lahore is Badshahi Masjid, or Badshahi Mosque. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, situated in the Walled City of Lahore, right in front of the Lahore Fort's Alamgiri Gate and Hazuri Bagh. It was constructed over a period of 3 years in the 17th century under the orders of the sixth Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb Alamgir. The full name of the mosque is Masjid Abul Zafar Muhy-ud-Din Mohammad Alamgir Badshah Ghazi.
As the 5th largest mosque in the world and 2nd largest in Pakistan, it can accommodate more than 100,000 worshippers at a time, both in its courtyard and the main hall. The mosque is built with red stones that were imported from Jaipur, India. The interior of the mosque is adorned with white marble and features intricate floral patterns that perfectly add to its beauty.
During the Sikh and British Rule, the mosque suffered significant neglect and destruction, as it was used for military purposes and as a horse stable for many years. However, thanks to the efforts of the Muslims in the Sub-Continent, it was eventually restored for religious use.
Notable figures such as Sikandar Hayat Khan and Nawab Zen Yar Jang Bahadur played important roles in the mosque's impressive restoration. Today, Badshahi Mosque is used for daily prayers and has become a major tourist attraction in Lahore, Pakistan. Your Walled City Tour will be incomplete without this mosque.`,

    text: `Third on the list of places to visit in Lahore is Wazir Khan Mosque. It was built during Shah Jahan's rule when he appointed Ilm-ud-Din Ansari as his vizier and the Governor Of Lahore. During his duty years, he built many renowned structures in the Walled City of Lahore, like the Wazir Khan Mosque (17th century) and the Shahi Hammam near the Delhi Gate Lahore. Ilm-ud-Din was known as Wazir Khan, the title granted to him by the Shah Jahan, and hence the mosque is also known as the Wazir Khan Mosque. The construction was completed in 7 years, from 1634 to 1641.
It is located on the Royal Route (Shahi Guzargah) Lahore and was used for the Friday Prayers by the royals at that time. There is a tomb of the saint Syed Mohammad Ishaq Gazrooni in the large courtyard of the mosque that was there even before the mosque was constructed. The mosque has four minarets and five dooms (Gumbad), and every wall is expertly and intricately decorated with Kashi Kari and Fresco Paintings.
The entrance gate of the mosque has a veranda and two separate spaces dedicated to a market, which is known as the Caligrapher's Market; calligraphers used to sit inside the rooms in that space. This space and other walls of the mosque are made with red stones.`,
